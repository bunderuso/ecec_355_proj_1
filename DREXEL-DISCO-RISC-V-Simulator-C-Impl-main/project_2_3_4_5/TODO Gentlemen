1. Add function information for each step, as in figure out what variables need to be passed in since we are dealing with functions now and not if-statements
  1.1 Look at the variables in- use throughout the functions to see what wee need in there since additional functions may need to be called upon 

2. Use Ben's linked list functions to add the needed details for each step. // 
  2.1 Details include fetch, execute, opcode, funct3, memory, etc 

3. Ensure the pipeclock counter is counting correctly and we can move through the linked list without any issues
  3.1 Perhaps make a global linked list variable so we can always move forward when the pipeline resets after each clock cycle 

4. Debug like crazy

I think that is everything that needs to be done
